# Crypto Mania

## This Project was build in 4 days during my time at Code Chrisalis Coding Bootcamp in Tokyo

Crypto Currency Portfolio app that let's you look up crypto quotes and price information and save it to a database.
Users can create an account and sign up, log in, add crypto currencies and coins, check current prices.

## Demo
